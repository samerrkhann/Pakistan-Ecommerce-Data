Special Thanks to Dr Zeeshan Usmani for making this data public.

## Context
This is the largest retail e-commerce orders dataset from Pakistan. It contains half a million transaction records from March 2016 to August 2018. The data was collected from various e-commerce merchants as part of a research study. I am releasing this dataset as a capstone project for my data science course at Alnafi (alnafi.com/zusmani).
There is a dire need for such dataset to learn about Pakistan’s emerging e-commerce potential and I hope this will help many startups in many ways.

## Content

## Acknowledgements
I like to thank all the startups who are trying to make their mark in Pakistan despite the unavailability of research data.

## Motivation
I have tried to visualize series of relationship to identify the patterns in the dataset. I have also graphed and documented the special trends and findings. 

## Inspiration
I’d like to call the attention of my fellow Kagglers to use Machine Learning and Data Sciences to help me explore these ideas:

- What is the best-selling category?
- Visualize payment method and order status frequency
- Find a correlation between payment method and order status
- Find a correlation between order date and item category
- Find any hidden patterns that are counter-intuitive for a layman
- Can we predict number of orders, or item category or number of customers/amount in advance?
